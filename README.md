## 🚀 Deployment

Visit [Next.js Deployment docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more information.

## 🧑🏻‍💻 Development

This project uses TypeScript for type checking, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting which
is configured in `.eslintrc.js`, and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in
this project. It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your editor and install an editor
plugin (like the [VSCode Prettier plugin](https://s.id/vscode-prettier)) to get auto-formatting
on saving and get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete.
